# CPP Website
Website for the competitive programming club at the University of Minnesota.

This website is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Getting Started

All of the required tools can be easily installed with Node Package Manager (`npm`) which comes with an installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Here are the steps to get started:

1. Download Node.js, here's a link to its main page: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Open a terminal
3. Clone this repo and navigate into it with the following commands:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cppumn/website.git
    cd website
    ```
4. Navigate to the `cpp-website` directory within the repo:   
    ```bash
    cd cpp-website
    ```
5. Ensure there is a `package.json` file in you current directory.
6. Install all the requirements:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
After this, you should be done with all the installation! The `README.md` in the `cpp-website` directory will give you more information on running and deploying the site.
