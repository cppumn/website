    <h2> Welcome to the Competitive Programming Club (CPP) </h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        We're a student group at the University of Minnesota interested in competitive programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to create an environment where students can hone their speed and accuracy in solving challenging problems, learn new programming concepts, and prepare for competitions and interviews.
